Network Inference in Stochastic Systems
==============================================

Introduction
-----------------------------
The project was designed to develop a data-driven approach for network inference in stochastic systems. From configurations of variables, we want to identify the interactions between them, then make a prediction. We compare the performace of our method with other existing methods such as mean field approximations, maximum likelihood stimation.
